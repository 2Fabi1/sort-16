Sort-16 is a browser-based puzzle game where players rearrange a shuffled string of characters using bracket-based shifting mechanics. The goal is to restore the original sequence using the fewest moves possible.

🎮 How It Works

Choose a difficulty level (8–36 characters).

A random string is generated from the template 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.

Use keyboard controls to manipulate a bracketed segment:

a / d: Move bracket left/right

← / →: Rotate characters inside the bracket

r: Restart the game
